# Sleep_Scheduled-routing-in-Wireless-Sensor-Networks
In order to minimize energy consumption of sensor nodes in wireless sensor networks,
this paper presents an Energy Efficient Sleep-Scheduled Tree-Based Routing Protocol (EESSTBRP) that modifies 
the chain formation in PEGASIS to create a set of paired and unpaired nodes in the network based on a distance and
sensing range threshold. The paired nodes switch between active and sleep modes so as to remove redundant data and 
save battery power. To minimize energy consumption as nodes switching between the modes, this scheme considers the
transitioning to be done based on a point of near depletion of the nodes’ residual energy. To further reduce energy 
consumption during transmission, this protocol utilizes prim’s minimum spanning tree mechanism to route data from the
active nodes to the Base Station (BS). Simulation results show that this proposed mechanism can significantly improve
network lifetime in comparison to PEGASIS
